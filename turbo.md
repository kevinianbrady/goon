Yooo, if someone need some help with good threads, then here you go 

 Thread ideas
 1. whitepaper (added when finalized)
 2. 1B or death fund
 3. our X space meetings
 4. our community set up (roles, team competitions etc) 
 5. Our blueprint (ill add the link/file when needed)
 6. Our dune dashboard https://dune.com/n11ck/polygoon-statistics
7. meme’s and our memepage link
8. «why i am so bullish on $goon» (write a personal reason on why you
Believe in goon.
 9. «why Im so bullish on polygon in itself» bring up agglayer, possible token relaunch later on (people in crypto loves new tokens)
10. Talk about the Grant, and that we are applying for it. 

How to create a «perfect raid» 

So initially there is no exact blueprint to a perfect raid, a perfect raid is made to one specific post.

Say someone has made a post where the owner is writing about how bullish he/she is on the “agglayer”.

The perfect answer to that post isn’t something like “buy $goon:imp:”, the perfect answer for that would be 

“dude, I’m so hyped for the “egglayer”,
Polygon is and will always be on top:star_struck: 
however imo they need more strong memecoins like $GOON:rocket::imp:

Post that, create a raid in main tg with
/raid “twitter link” “10” “5” “5” 0; 

And continue to hype people to post memes, and tg link.


COORDINATED RAIDS 

Here comes the fun part, one of the ideas I had when I started the raid team, is that we can have 1 hour chats/vc’s in the telegram or discord where we all scout X together and send fresh posts for raids.

When we initially find a “perfect” post then we all gang up on it to create quality responses to that specific post.

After that we continue to raid and comment each others raids. 

So we can in theory have 10-20 posts about goon with all 10-20 likes and comments on the same post. That will be a raiding powerhouse. If we do that 10 times in one hour, then we initially have a 100-200 posts. 

When/if one of those posts gets really successfull and makes it to a 100k following X memecoin individual and he calls it out, then we will be getting many eyes on us, lol
