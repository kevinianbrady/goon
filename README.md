   Alternatively, you can stage individual files by specifying their names:
    ```bash
    git add filename.py
    ```
3. Commit your changes with a message describing what you did:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    ```

## Pushing Changes

1. To push your committed changes to the repository on GitHub, type:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
   If you are using a branch other than `main`, replace `main` with the name of your branch.
